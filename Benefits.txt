Security. SS prevents unauthorized listening. Unless a receiver has a very wide
bandwidth and the exact pseudorandom code and type of modulation, it cannot intercept an SS signal.

Resistance to jamming and interference. Jamming signals are typically restricted
to a single frequency, and jamming one frequency does not interfere with an SS
signal. Similarly, unintentional interference from a signal occupying the same band
is greatly minimized and in most cases virtually eliminated.

Band sharing. Many users can share a single band with little or no interference.
(As more and more signals use a band, the background noise produced by the switching 
of many signals increases, but not enough to prevent highly reliable communication.)

Resistance to fading and multipath propagation. Frequency-selective fading
occurs during signal propagation because signals of different frequencies arrive at a
receiver at slightly different times due to rel ections from other objects. SS virtually
eliminates wide variations of signal strength due to rel ections and other phenomena
during propagation.
